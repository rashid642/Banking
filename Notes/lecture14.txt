RPC - Remote procedure call 

1. Define API and data structre
The RPC and it's req/res structre are defined using protobuf 

2. Generate gRPC stubs 
Generate codes for the server and client in the language of your choice 

3. Implement server 
Implement the RPC handler on the server side 

4. Use the client 

Advantages
1. High Performace
 - binary framing 
 - Multiplexing - combining multiple request into a single one 
 - Compression
 - Bidirectional commnunication 

2. String API contract 
 - Server and client share the same protobuf
 - RPC definition with strongly typed data 

3. Automatic generated code 

Types of GRPC 
1. Unary gRPC - Single request from both client and server 
2. Client streaming gRPC - Client sends multiple streams of multiple messages 
3. Server streaming gRPC - Client send single message and server reply with stream of multiple messages
4. Bidirectional gRPC - Client and server both sends  stream of multiple messages
