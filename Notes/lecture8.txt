--> Locks and Deadlocks

If multiple transaction tries to getAccount and then update the balance
It's possible that they read the same Balance 
so if two transaction need to deduct 10 and 10 from a account 
and current account balance is 100 
as expected it should reduce to 80
but it only goes to 90 

as first transaction read 100 and reduces it to 90
2nd transaction also read 100 and recdues it to 90 

SELECT * FROM account 
WHERE id = $1 LIMIT 1
FOR NO KEY UPDATE;

--> For update help us to block the other transaction from reading the amount when other transaction is going on 
--> NO KEY Update help us to not to block the key from access, 
--> Suppose if some other table has account id as foreign key then it will also not be able to access it 
--> but as it has nothing to do with the balance it can update 
--> so key isn't included here 

One more dead lock condition is when 
--> Update account1 and then account2 
--> Update account2 and then account1
